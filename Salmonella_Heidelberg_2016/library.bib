abstract = {MOTIVATION: The current molecular data explosion poses new challenges for large-scale phylogenomic analyses that can comprise hundreds or even thousands of genes. A property that characterizes phylogenomic datasets is that they tend to be gappy, i.e. can contain taxa with (many and disparate) missing genes. In current phylogenomic analyses, this type of alignment gappyness that is induced by missing data frequently exceeds 90{\%}. We present and implement a generally applicable mechanism that allows for reducing memory footprints of likelihood-based [maximum likelihood (ML) or Bayesian] phylogenomic analyses proportional to the amount of missing data in the alignment. We also introduce a set of algorithmic rules to efficiently conduct tree searches via subtree pruning and re-grafting moves using this mechanism. RESULTS: On a large phylogenomic DNA dataset with 2177 taxa, 68 genes and a gappyness of 90{\%}, we achieve a memory footprint reduction from 9 GB down to 1 GB, a speedup for optimizing ML model parameters of 11, and accelerate the Subtree Pruning Regrafting tree search phase by factor 16. Thus, our approach can be deployed to improve efficiency for the two most important resources, CPU time and memory, by up to one order of magnitude.

abstract = {There is a lack of consensus on how next-generation sequence data should be considered for phylogenetic and phylogeographic estimates, with some studies excluding loci with missing data, while others include them, even when sequences are missing from a large number of individuals. Here we use simulations, focusing specifically on RAD sequences, to highlight some of the unforeseen consequence of excluding missing data from next-generation sequencing. Specifically, we show that in addition to the obvious effects associated with reducing the amount of data used to make historical inferences, the decisions we make about missing data (such as the minimum number of individuals with a sequence for a locus to be included in the study) also impact the types of loci sampled for a study. In particular, as the tolerance for missing data becomes more stringent, the mutational spectrum represented in the sampled loci becomes truncated such that loci with the highest mutation rates are disproportionately excluded. This effect is exacerbated further by factors involved in the preparation of the genomic library (i.e., the use of reduced representation libraries, as well as the coverage) and the taxonomic diversity represented in the library (i.e., the level of divergence among the individuals). We demonstrate that the intuitive appeals about being conservative by removing loci may be misguided.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic Bootstrapping (BS) is a standard technique for inferring confidence values on phylogenetic trees that is based on reconstructing many trees from minor variations of the input data, trees called replicates. BS is used with all phylogenetic reconstruction approaches, but we focus here on the most popular, Maximum Likelihood (ML). Because ML inference is so computationally demanding, it has proved too expensive to date to assess the impact of the number of replicates used in BS on the quality of the support values. For the same reason, a rather small number (typically 100) of BS replicates are computed in real-world studies. Stamatakis et al. recently introduced a BS algorithm that is 1–2 orders of magnitude faster than previous techniques, while yielding qualitatively comparable support values, making an experimental study possible. In this paper, we propose stopping criteria , that is, thresholds computed at runtime to determine when enough replicates have been generated, and report on the first large-scale experimental study to assess the effect of the number of replicates on the quality of support values, including the performance of our proposed criteria. We run our tests on 17 diverse real-world DNA, single-gene as well as multi-gene, datasets, that include between 125 and 2,554 sequences. We find that our stopping criteria typically stop computations after 100–500 replicates (although the most conservative criterion may continue for several thousand replicates) while producing support values that correlate at better than 99.5{\%} with the reference values on the best ML trees. Significantly, we also find that the stopping criteria can recommend very different numbers of replicates for different datasets of comparable sizes. Our results are thus two-fold: (i) they give the first experimental assessment of the effect of the number of BS replicates on the quality of support values returned through bootstrapping; and (ii) they validate our proposals for stopping criteria. Practitioners will no longer have to enter a guess nor worry about the quality of support values; moreover, with most counts of replicates in the 100–500 range, robust BS under ML inference becomes computationally practical for most datasets. The complete test suite is available at http://lcbb.epfl.ch/BS.tar.bz2 and BS with our stopping criteria is included in RAxML 7.1.0.},
annote = {The amount of bootstraps required before convergence differs per data set, so bootstopping criteria should be used on a per alignment basis.

They look at two metrics:
- RF (for Robinson-Foulds) metric (or symmetric difference) is a dissimilarity metric between two trees, counts the number of bipartitions that occur in one tree an not the other.
The RF distance count is incremented by one for each bipartition that is not found in both trees

RFW (Weighted Robinson-Foulds): generalizes the RF metric, by summing the weights ofthe bipartitions that contribute to the RF metric (so it sums the weight of the bipartitions that do not occur in both trees? But what is the weight of a bipartition, is that its support value in the tree that has it? Dit is WC, or Weight based

MR (Majority Rule), a consensus method. MR takes a set of trees, and returns a single summary tree that contains only bipartitions that occur in more than 50{\%} of input trees. Dit is waarschijnlijk FC, frequency based.

MRE(Extended Majority Rule, or greedy consensus), starts with MR, and greedily adds rarer bipartitions, adding the most frequent first, in the hopes of obtaining a fully bifurcating tree. Though this is not always possible.

Stopping criteria
* Split the set of bootstrap replicates into equal halves
* Compute statistics described above for the two halves
* If the statistics for both halves are similar, adding more replicates wont help, and we have converged. If they are similar, we do more bootstrap replicates
* Actually, we do 100 random splits of the data and compute the statistics over these 100 samples.},

abstract = {Bioinformatics is experiencing a rapid and overwhelming accumulation of molecular sequence data, predominantly driven by novel wet-lab sequencing techniques. This trend poses scalability challenges for tool developers. In the field of phylogenetic inference (reconstruction of evolutionary trees from molecular sequence data), scalability is becoming an increasingly important issue for operations other than the tree reconstruction itself. In this paper we focus on post-analysis tasks in reconstructing very large trees, specifically the step of building (extended) majority rule consensus trees from a collection of equally plausible trees or a collection of bootstrap replicate trees. To this end we present non-parallel optimizations which establish our implementation as the fastest exact implementation in phylogenetics, and our novel parallelized routines are the first of their kind. Our non-parallel optimizations achieve a performance improvement of factor 50 compared to the previous version of our code and we achieve a maximum speedup of 5.5 on a 8-core Nehalem node for building consensus trees comprising up to 55,000 organisms. We also present a parallel approach for drawing bootstrap support values on a candidate tree, and experimentally assess our approach in order to better understand read-only versus read-write parallel hash table accesses on multi-core systems. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

There are multiple computational approaches available that perform a similar task: call variants by mapping short read data against a reference genome, quality filter these variants, then concatenate the variants into a sequence matrix for downstream phylogenetic analysis. However, there are no existing methods to validate the accuracy of these approaches despite the fact that we know there are parameters that can affect whether a SNP is called, or the correct tree is recovered. We present a simulation approach (TreeToReads) to generate raw read data from mutated genomes simulated under a known phylogeny.

abstract = {We re-analyzed 10 sparse supermatrices wherein the original authors relied primarily or entirely upon maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses implemented in RAxML and quantified branch support using the bootstrap. We compared the RAxML-based topologies and bootstrap values with both superficial- and relatively thorough-tree-search parsimony topologies and bootstrap values. We tested for clades that were resolved by RAxML but properly unsupported by checking if the SH-like aLRT equals zero and/or if the parsimony-optimized minimum branch length equals zero. Four of our conclusions are as follows. (1) Despite sampling nearly 50,000 characters, highly supported branches in a RAxML tree may be entirely unsupported because of missing data. (2) One should not rely entirely upon RAxML SH-like aLRT, RAxML bootstrap, or superficial parsimony bootstrap methods to rigorously quantify branch support for sparse supermatrices. (3) A fundamental factor that favors thorough parsimony analyses of sparse supermatrices is being able to distinguish between clades that are unequivocally supported by the data from those that are not; superficial likelihood analyses that quantify branch support using the bootstrap cannot be relied upon to always make this distinction. (4) The SH-like aLRT and parsimony-optimized-minimum-branch-length tests generally identify the same properly unsupported clades; the latter is a more severe test. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the work presented here, we designed and developed two easy-to-use Web tools for in silico detection and characterization of whole-genome sequence (WGS) and whole-plasmid sequence data from members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. These tools will facilitate bacterial typing based on draft genomes of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae species by the rapid detection of known plasmid types. Replicon sequences from 559 fully sequenced plasmids associated with the family Enterobacteriaceae in the NCBI nucleotide database were collected to build a consensus database for integration into a Web tool called PlasmidFinder that can be used for replicon sequence analysis of raw, contig group, or completely assembled and closed plasmid sequencing data. The PlasmidFinder database currently consists of 116 replicon sequences that match with at least at 80{\%} nucleotide identity all replicon sequences identified in the 559 fully sequenced plasmids. For plasmid multilocus sequence typing (pMLST) analysis, a database that is updated weekly was generated from www.pubmlst.org and integrated into a Web tool called pMLST. Both databases were evaluated using draft genomes from a collection of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates. PlasmidFinder identified a total of 103 replicons and between zero and five different plasmid replicons within each of 49 S. Typhimurium draft genomes tested. The pMLST Web tool was able to subtype genomic sequencing data of plasmids, revealing both known plasmid sequence types (STs) and new alleles and ST variants. In conclusion, testing of the two Web tools using both fully assembled plasmid sequences and WGS-generated draft genomes showed them to be able to detect a broad variety of plasmids that are often associated with antimicrobial resistance in clinically relevant bacterial pathogens.},

abstract = {Concerns about the deleterious effects of missing data may often determine which characters and taxa are included in phylogenetic analyses. For example, researchers may exclude taxa lacking data for some genes or exclude a gene lacking data in some taxa. Yet, there may be very little evidence to support these decisions. In this paper, I review the effects of missing data on phylogenetic analyses. Recent simulations suggest that highly incomplete taxa can be accurately placed in phylogenies, as long as many characters have been sampled overall. Furthermore, adding incomplete taxa can dramatically improve results in some cases by subdividing misleading long branches. Adding characters with missing data can also improve accuracy, although there is a risk of long-branch attraction in some cases. Consideration of how missing data does (or does not) affect phylogenetic analyses may allow researchers to design studies that can reconstruct large phylogenies quickly, economically, and accurately. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

annote = {When the number of character is high ({\textgreater}2000), the correct tree can be reconstructed even if half of all taxa are missing 90{\%} of their data

Clearly, the number and proportion of missing data is not important, only the number of complete characters.

Maar, dit blijft wel een probleem met long branch attraction

When 50{\%} of the data cells were unknown, every branch of the phylogeny was reconstructed cor- rectly in all 100 replicates (using maximum likelihood, the only method they considered).

On the positive side, there is abundant evidence that increasing the number of char- acter generally increases phylogenetic accuracy [1,12, 44,47]. The major exception is in cases of long-branch attraction [16,43,44,47]. On the negative side, missing data cells may actually create long-branch attraction in sets of incomplete characters. This creates a potential situation in which adding a large number of highly incomplete characters may reduce phylogenetic accuracy.


NOTE: THIS IS FOR PARSIMONY ONLY
However, the re-sults also showed that as the proportion of missing data
in the added characters increased, the ability of the
added characters to increase accuracy quickly decreased.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the "CAT" approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100-1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

abstract = {Reduced-representation genome sequencing represents a new source of data for systematics, and its potential utility in interspecific phylogeny reconstruction has not yet been explored. One approach that seems especially promising is the use of inexpensive short-read technologies (e.g., Illumina, SOLiD) to sequence restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) ‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}} the regions of the genome that flank the recognition sites of restriction enzymes. In this study, we simulated the collection of RAD sequences from sequenced genomes of different taxa (Drosophila, mammals, and yeasts) and developed a proof-of-concept workflow to test whether informative data could be extracted and used to accurately reconstruct ‚{\"{A}}{\'{u}}known‚{\"{A}}{\`{u}} phylogenies of species within each group. The workflow consists of three basic steps: first, sequences are clustered by similarity to estimate orthology; second, clusters are filtered by taxonomic coverage; and third, they are aligned and concatenated for ‚{\"{A}}{\'{u}}total evidence‚{\"{A}}{\`{u}} phylogenetic analysis. We evaluated the performance of clustering and filtering parameters by comparing the resulting topologies with well-supported reference trees and we were able to identify conditions under which the reference tree was inferred with high support. For Drosophila, whole genome alignments allowed us to directly evaluate which parameters most consistently recovered orthologous sequences. For the parameter ranges explored, we recovered the best results at the low ends of sequence similarity and taxonomic representation of loci; these generated the largest supermatrices with the highest proportion of missing data. Applications of the method to mammals and yeasts were less successful, which we suggest may be due partly to their much deeper evolutionary divergence times compared to Drosophila (crown ages of approximately 100 and 300 versus 60 Mya, respectively). RAD sequences thus appear to hold promise for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships in younger clades in which sufficient numbers of orthologous restriction sites are retained across species.},

abstract = {We present an evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) and a Web server for the rapid assignment of sequence fragments (short reads) to edges of a given phylogenetic tree under the maximum-likelihood model. The accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated on several real-world data sets and compared with placement by pair-wise sequence comparison, using edit distances and BLAST. We introduce a slow and accurate as well as a fast and less accurate placement algorithm. For the slow algorithm, we develop additional heuristic techniques that yield almost the same run times as the fast version with only a small loss of accuracy. When those additional heuristics are employed, the run time of the more accurate algorithm is comparable with that of a simple BLAST search for data sets with a high number of short query sequences. Moreover, the accuracy of the EPA is significantly higher, in particular when the sample of taxa in the reference topology is sparse or inadequate. Our algorithm, which has been integrated into RAxML, therefore provides an equally fast but more accurate alternative to BLAST for tree-based inference of the evolutionary origin and composition of short sequence reads. We are also actively developing a Web server that offers a freely available service for computing read placements on trees using the EPA.},

abstract = {Progress in sequencing technology allows researchers to assemble ever-larger supermatrices for phylogenomic inference. However, current phylogenomic studies often rest on patchy data sets, with some having 80{\%} missing (or ambiguous) data or more. Though early simulations had suggested that missing data per se do not harm phylogenetic inference when using sufficiently large data sets, Lemmon et al. (Lemmon AR, Brown JM, Stanger-Hall K, Lemmon EM. 2009. The effect of ambiguous data on phylogenetic estimates obtained by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Syst Biol. 58:130-145.) have recently cast doubt on this consensus in a study based on the introduction of parsimony-uninformative incomplete characters. In this work, we empirically reassess the issue of missing data in phylogenomics while exploring possible interactions with the model of sequence evolution. First, we note that parsimony-uninformative incomplete characters are actually informative in a probabilistic framework. A reanalysis of Lemmon's data set with this in mind gives a very different interpretation of their results and shows that some of their conclusions may be unfounded. Second, we investigate the effect of the progressive introduction of missing data in a complete supermatrix (126 genes × 39 species) capable of resolving animal relationships. These analyses demonstrate that missing data perturb phylogenetic inference slightly beyond the expected decrease in resolving power. In particular, they exacerbate systematic errors by reducing the number of species effectively available for the detection of multiple substitutions. Consequently, large sparse supermatrices are more sensitive to phylogenetic artifacts than smaller but less incomplete data sets, which argue for experimental designs aimed at collecting a modest number ({\~{}}50) of highly covered genes. Our results further confirm that including incomplete yet short-branch taxa (i.e., slowly evolving species or close outgroups) can help to eschew artifacts, as predicted by simulations. Finally, it appears that selecting an adequate model of sequence evolution (e.g., the site-heterogeneous CAT model instead of the site-homogeneous WAG model) is more beneficial to phylogenetic accuracy than reducing the level of missing data.},

abstract = {Non-random distributions of missing data are a general problem for likelihood-based statistical analyses, including those in a phylogenetic context. Extensive non-randomly distributed missing data are particularly problematic in supermatrix analyses that include many terminals and/or loci. It has been widely reported that missing data can lead to loss of resolution, but only very rarely create misleading or otherwise unsupported results in a parsimony context. Yet this does not hold for all parametric-based analyses because of their assumption of homogeneity across characters and lineages, which can lead to both long-branch attraction and long-branch repulsion. Contrived examples were used to demonstrate that non-random distributions of missing data, even without rate heterogeneity among characters and a well fitting model, can provide misleading likelihood-based topologies and branch-support values that are radically unstable based on slight modifications to character sampling. The same can occur despite complete absence of parsimony-informative characters. Otherwise unsupported resolution and high branch support for these clades were found to occur frequently in 22 empirical examples derived from a published supermatrix. Partitioning characters based on the distribution of missing data helped to decrease, but did not eliminate, these artifacts. These artifacts were exacerbated by low quality tree searches, particularly when holding only a single optimal tree that must be fully resolved. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Quantifying branch support using the bootstrap and/or jackknife is generally considered to be an essential component of rigorous parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses. Previous authors have described how application of the frequency-within-replicates approach to treating multiple equally optimal trees found in a given bootstrap pseudoreplicate can provide apparent support for otherwise unsupported clades. We demonstrate how a similar problem may occur when a non-representative subset of equally optimal trees are held per pseudoreplicate, which we term the undersampling-within-replicates artifact. We illustrate the frequency-within-replicates and undersampling-within-replicates bootstrap and jackknife artifacts using both contrived and empirical examples, demonstrate that the artifacts can occur in both parsimony and likelihood analyses, and show that the artifacts occur in outputs from multiple different phylogenetic-inference programs. Based on our results, we make the following five recommendations, which are particularly relevant to supermatrix analyses, but apply to all phylogenetic analyses. First, when two or more optimal trees are found in a given pseudoreplicate they should be summarized using the strict-consensus rather than frequency-within-replicates approach. Second jackknife resampling should be used rather than bootstrap resampling. Third, multiple tree searches while holding multiple trees per search should be conducted in each pseudoreplicate rather than conducting only a single search and holding only a single tree. Fourth, branches with a minimum possible optimized length of zero should be collapsed within each tree search rather than collapsing branches only if their maximum possible optimized length is zero. Fifth, resampling values should be mapped onto the strict consensus of all optimal trees found rather than simply presenting the ???50{\%} bootstrap or jackknife tree or mapping the resampling values onto a single optimal tree. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper explores the possibility of using standard, well-behaved Markov models for estimating morphological phylogenies (including branch lengths) under the likelihood criterion. An important modification of standard Markov models involves making the likelihood conditional on characters being variable, because constant characters are absent in morphological data sets. Without this modification, branch lengths are often overestimated, resulting in potentially serious biases in tree topology selection. Several new avenues of research are opened by an explicitly model-based approach to phylogenetic analysis of discrete morphological data, including combined-data likelihood analyses (morphology + sequence data), likelihood ratio tests, and Bayesian analyses.},

Incongruence severity increased for shorter internodes located deeper in the phylogeny. Notably, whereas most practices had little or negative impact on the yeast phylogeny, the use of genes or internodes with high average internode support significantly improved the robustness of inference.

Within the 67 strains analyzed, we identified 52 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis XbaI profiles, 12 different multilocus sequence types (STs), and 18 different pathogenicity array types. The relatedness of strains based on the pathogenicity gene repertoire (102 markers tested) was in good agreement with grouping by MLST.

The bias can lead to high bootstrap, SH-like aLRT support (up to 100{\%}), and posterior probabilities for the conflicting clades. The bias can occur even when only a single terminal has missing data. The bias is not limited to likelihood methods that only ever present a single optimal tree that is fully resolved (as in PhyML and RAxML)-it can also occur in branch-and-bound PAUP* searches. The bias persists despite sampling numerous characters, and the bias is consistently unidirectional. The bias may occur in the context of incongruence between gene trees as well as within a single gene wherein terminals have different sequence lengths caused by DNA-amplification differences or gaps caused by indels.

abstract = {— The problem of missing data is often considered to be the most important obstacle in reconstructing the phylogeny of fossil taxa and in combining data from diverse characters and taxa for phylogenetic analysis. Empirical and theoretical studies show that including highly incomplete taxa can lead to multiple equally parsimonious trees, poorly resolved con-sensus trees, and decreased phylogenetic accuracy. However, the mechanisms that cause incomplete taxa to be problematic have remained unclear. It has been widely assumed that incomplete taxa are problematic because of the proportion or amount of missing data that they bear. In this study, I use simulations to show that the reduced accuracy associated with including incomplete taxa is caused by these taxa bearing too few complete characters rather than too many missing data cells. This seemingly subtle distinction has a number of important implications. First, the so-called missing data problem for incomplete taxa is, paradoxically, not directly related to their amount or proportion of missing data. Thus, the level of completeness alone should not guide the exclusion of taxa (contrary to common practice), and these results may explain why empirical studies have sometimes found little relationship between the completeness of a taxon and its impact on an analysis. These results also (1) suggest a more effective strategy for dealing with incomplete taxa, (2) call into question a justification of the controversial phylogenetic supertree approach, and (3) show the potential for the accurate phylogenetic placement of highly incomplete taxa, both when combining diverse data sets and when analyzing relationships of fossil taxa.},
annote = {Excluding taxa based on missing data (eg, exclude if more that 50{\%} of character missing). This assumes that incomplete taxa are a problem because of the missing data, and that missing data cells are 'to blame'

An alternative hypothesis is that taxa with missing data cannot be place because they have too few characters with data to place them.

This paper tests the two hypothesis with simulations, and finds the second to be correct},

abstract = {Phylogeneticists often design their studies to maximize the number of genes included but minimize the overall amount of missing data. However, few studies have addressed the costs and benefits of adding characters with missing data, especially for likelihood analyses of multiple loci. In this paper, we address this topic using two empirical data sets (in yeast and plants) with well-resolved phylogenies. We introduce varying amounts of missing data into varying numbers of genes and test whether the benefits of excluding genes with missing data outweigh the costs of excluding the non-missing data that are associated with them. We also test if there is a proportion of missing data in the incomplete genes at which they cease to be beneficial or harmful, and whether missing data consistently bias branch length estimates.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To study the resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Salmonella strains isolated from humans in a 5 year period in Spain, and to identify the responsible genes and their dissemination. METHODS: Twenty-seven isolates were analysed by PCR and sequencing to identify the genes responsible for the beta-lactamase resistance phenotypes. The transferability of the phenotypes was tested by conjugation to Escherichia coli K12J53, plasmid detection with S1-PFGE, hybridization and PCRs of the transconjugants. The genetic relationship was determined by PFGE. RESULTS: We found bla(CTX-M-9) and bla(CTX-M-10) in Salmonella Virchow PT19. bla(CTX-M-14) was detected in Salmonella (IV) 44:z(4),z(23):-, Salmonella Enteritidis PT6a, Salmonella Typhimurium DT193 and Salmonella Typhimurium DT104B. bla(CTX-M-1) was found in Salmonella Litchfield. bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(CTX-M-32) were found in Salmonella Enteritidis PT1. bla(SHV-12) was found in Salmonella Blockley, Salmonella Hadar PT2, Salmonella Enteritidis PT21, Salmonella Enteritidis PT1 and Salmonella Bredeney. bla(SHV-2) was found in Salmonella Livingstone. bla(CMY-2) was detected in Salmonella Bredeney, Salmonella Newport, Salmonella Enteritidis PT5b and Salmonella Heidelberg. bla(DHA-1) was detected for the first time in Spain in Salmonella Newport. One strain of Salmonella Senftenberg harboured two extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, bla(SHV-12) and bla(CTX-M-9). We have found a large variety of beta-lactamase families as well as several members of major relevance, such as CTX-M-15, CTX-M-32, CMY-2 and DHA-1. XbaI-PFGE, conjugation assays and S1-PFGE hybridization showed that all these beta-lactamases were mediated by plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the emergence of a public health risk related to resistance to beta-lactams in Salmonella. The resistance trends need to be monitored carefully.},

abstract = {Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic trees. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.},

abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances achieved by application of high-performance computing methods and novel algorithmic techniques to maximum likelihood (ML)-based inference programs, the major computational bottleneck still consists in the computation of bootstrap support values. Conducting a probably insufficient number of 100 bootstrap (BS) analyses with current ML programs on large datasets-either with respect to the number of taxa or base pairs-can easily require a month of run time. Therefore, we have developed, implemented, and thoroughly tested rapid bootstrap heuristics in RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) that are more than an order of magnitude faster than current algorithms. These new heuristics can contribute to resolving the computational bottleneck and improve current methodology in phylogenetic analyses. Computational experiments to assess the performance and relative accuracy of these heuristics were conducted on 22 diverse DNA and AA (amino acid), single gene as well as multigene, real-world alignments containing 125 up to 7764 sequences. The standard BS (SBS) and rapid BS (RBS) values drawn on the best-scoring ML tree are highly correlated and show almost identical average support values. The weighted RF (Robinson-Foulds) distance between SBS- and RBS-based consensus trees was smaller than 6{\%} in all cases (average 4{\%}). More importantly, RBS inferences are between 8 and 20 times faster (average 14.73) than SBS analyses with RAxML and between 18 and 495 times faster than BS analyses with competing programs, such as PHYML or GARLI. Moreover, this performance improvement increases with alignment size. Finally, we have set up two freely accessible Web servers for this significantly improved version of RAxML that provide access to the 200-CPU cluster of the Vital-IT unit at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the 128-CPU cluster of the CIPRES project at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. These Web servers offer the possibility to conduct large-scale phylogenetic inferences to a large part of the community that does not have access to, or the expertise to use, high-performance computing resources.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic inference is generally performed on the basis of multiple sequence alignments (MSA). Because errors in an alignment can lead to errors in tree estimation, there is a strong interest in identifying and removing unreliable parts of the alignment. In recent years several automated filtering approaches have been proposed, but despite their popularity, a systematic and comprehensive comparison of different alignment filtering methods on real data has been lacking. Here, we extend and apply recently introduced phylogenetic tests of alignment accuracy on a large number of gene families and contrast the performance of unfiltered versus filtered alignments in the context of single-gene phylogeny reconstruction. Based on multiple genome-wide empirical and simulated data sets, we show that the trees obtained from filtered MSAs are on average worse than those obtained from unfiltered MSAs. Furthermore, alignment filtering often leads to an increase in the proportion of well-supported branches that are actually wrong. We confirm that our findings hold for a wide range of parameters and methods. Although our results suggest that light filtering (up to 20{\%} of alignment positions) has little impact on tree accuracy and may save some computation time, contrary to widespread practice, we do not generally recommend the use of current alignment filtering methods for phylogenetic inference. By providing a way to rigorously and systematically measure the impact of filtering on alignments, the methodology set forth here will guide the development of better filtering algorithms.},

By using data from 8 clinic-based cohorts from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design, drug-resistance mutations from those with genotype tests were determined and scored using the Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm developed at Stanford University. For each year from 2000 through 2005, the prevalence was calculated using data from the tested subset, assumptions that incorporated clinical knowledge, and multiple imputation methods to yield a complete data set. A total of 9,289 patients contributed data to the analysis; 3,959 had at least 1 viral load above 1,000 copies/mL, of whom 2,962 (75{\%}) had undergone at least 1 genotype test. Using these methods, the authors estimated that the prevalence of accumulated resistance to 2 or more antiretroviral drug classes had increased from 14{\%} in 2000 to 17{\%} in 2005 (P {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of resistance in the tested subset declined from 57{\%} to 36{\%} for 2 or more classes. The authors' use of clinical knowledge and multiple imputation methods revealed trends in HIV drug resistance among patients in care that were markedly different from those observed using only data from patients who had undergone genotype tests.},

Here we found that PtpA suppressed innate immunity dependent on pathways of the kinases Jnk and p38 and the transcription factor NF-$\kappa$B by exploiting host ubiquitin. Binding of PtpA to ubiquitin via a region with no homology to human proteins activated it to dephosphorylate phosphorylated Jnk and p38, leading to suppression of innate immunity. Furthermore, the host adaptor TAB3 mediated NF-$\kappa$B signaling by sensing ubiquitin chains, and PtpA blocked this process by competitively binding the ubiquitin-interacting domain of TAB3. Our findings reveal how pathogens subvert innate immunity by coopting host ubiquitin and suggest a potential tuberculosis treatment via targeting of ubiquitin-PtpA interfaces.},

abstract = {Most Salmonella serovars, including Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Senftenberg (S. Senftenberg), are tolerant to desiccation and able to colonize and persist in feed mills. In addition, they may survive cleaning and disinfection procedures used on poultry farms. The present study was conducted to investigate the survival of S. Senftenberg in broiler parent stock farms and broiler farms. The isolates from one of the parent stock farms investigated only differed by a single band in fluorescent amplified fragment-length polymorphism analysis and had identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles, indicating that a S. Senftenberg clone had persisted for more than 2 years, despite cleaning, disinfection, desiccation and depopulation, and was subsequently able to infect Salmonella-free layers. Isolates from the same house on a different broiler parent stock farm were found to be identical by amplified fragment-length polymorphism analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis although the farm tested negative for Salmonella 55 times over a period of 18 months between the two positive samplings. An assay was developed to investigate the survival of 34 S. Senftenberg isolates during desiccation at approximately 38{\%} relative humidity. On average, the viability of S. Senftenberg isolates decreased by 1000-fold over 35 days. The persistent clones were no more resistant to desiccation than the other isolates investigated. However, S. Senftenberg was more resistant to desiccation than an isolate of Pantoea agglomerans commonly found on poultry feed-processing lines. This study demonstrates the risk of persistence of feed-associated serovars such as S. Senftenberg.},

abstract = {Trees, including minimum spanning trees (MSTs), are commonly used in phylogenetic studies. But, for the research community, it may be unclear that the presented tree is just a hypothesis, chosen from among many possible alternatives. In this scenario, it is important to quantify our confidence in both the trees and the branches/edges included in such trees. In this paper, we address this problem for MSTs by introducing a new edge betweenness metric for undirected and weighted graphs. This spanning edge betweenness metric is defined as the fraction of equivalent MSTs where a given edge is present. The metric provides a per edge statistic that is similar to that of the bootstrap approach frequently used in phylogenetics to support the grouping of taxa. We provide methods for the exact computation of this metric based on the well known Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem. Moreover, we implement and make available a module for the PHYLOViZ software and evaluate the proposed metric concerning both effectiveness and computational performance. Analysis of trees generated using multilocus sequence typing data (MLST) and the goeBURST algorithm revealed that the space of possible MSTs in real data sets is extremely large. Selection of the edge to be represented using bootstrap could lead to unreliable results since alternative edges are present in the same fraction of equivalent MSTs. The choice of the MST to be presented, results from criteria implemented in the algorithm that must be based in biologically plausible models.},

abstract = {Third-generation cephalosporins are a class of $\beta$-lactam antibiotics that are often used for the treatment of human infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli. Worryingly, the incidence of human infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli is increasing worldwide. Recent studies have suggested that these E. coli strains, and their antibiotic resistance genes, can spread from food-producing animals, via the food-chain, to humans. However, these studies used traditional typing methods, which may not have provided sufficient resolution to reliably assess the relatedness of these strains. We therefore used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to study the relatedness of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli from humans, chicken meat, poultry and pigs. One strain collection included pairs of human and poultry-associated strains that had previously been considered to be identical based on Multi-Locus Sequence Typing, plasmid typing and antibiotic resistance gene sequencing. The second collection included isolates from farmers and their pigs. WGS analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity between human and poultry-associated isolates. The most closely related pairs of strains from both sources carried 1263 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) per Mbp core genome. In contrast, epidemiologically linked strains from humans and pigs differed by only 1.8 SNPs per Mbp core genome. WGS-based plasmid reconstructions revealed three distinct plasmid lineages (IncI1- and IncK-type) that carried cephalosporin resistance genes of the Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-types. The plasmid backbones within each lineage were virtually identical and were shared by genetically unrelated human and animal isolates. Plasmid reconstructions from short-read sequencing data were validated by long-read DNA sequencing for two strains. Our findings failed to demonstrate evidence for recent clonal transmission of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli strains from poultry to humans, as has been suggested based on traditional, low-resolution typing methods. Instead, our data suggest that cephalosporin resistance genes are mainly disseminated in animals and humans via distinct plasmids.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time. RESULTS: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both. AVAILABILITY: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net},

abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is the most common Salmonella serovar causing food borne infections in Australia and many other countries. Twenty one S. Typhimurium strains from Salmonella reference collection A (SARA) were analyzed using Illumina high-throughput genome sequencing. SNPs in 21 SARA strains range from 46 SNPs to 11,916 SNPs with an average of 1,577 SNPs per strain. Together with 47 selected from publicly available S. Typhimurium genomes, the S. Typhimurium core genes (STCG) was determined. The STCG consists of 3,846 genes, which is much larger than the set of 2,882 Salmonella core genes (SCG) found previously. The STCG together with 1,576 core intergenic regions (IGRs) was defined as the S. Typhimurium core genome. Using 93 S. Typhimurium genomes from 13 epidemiologically confirmed community outbreaks, we demonstrated that typing based on S. Typhimurium core genome (STCG+ core IGRs) provides superior resolution and higher discriminatory power than that based on SCG for outbreak investigation and molecular epidemiology of S. Typhimurium. Both STCG and STCG+ core IGRs typing achieved 100{\%} separation of all outbreaks in comprison to SCG typing which failed to separate isolates from two outbreaks from background isolates. Defining the S. Typhimurium core genome allows standardization of genes/regions to be used for high resolution epidemiological typing of S. Typhimurium for genomic surveillance.},

Here, we present a broad collection of additional Galaxy tools for large scale analysis of gene and protein sequences. The motivating research theme is the identification of specific genes of interest in a range of non-model organisms, and our central example is the identification and prediction of "effector" proteins produced by plant pathogens in order to manipulate their host plant. This functional annotation of a pathogen's predicted capacity for virulence is a key step in translating sequence data into potential applications in plant pathology. This collection includes novel tools, and widely-used third-party tools such as NCBI BLAST+ wrapped for use within Galaxy. Individual bioinformatics software tools are typically available separately as standalone packages, or in online browser-based form. The Galaxy framework enables the user to combine these and other tools to automate organism scale analyses as workflows, without demanding familiarity with command line tools and scripting. Workflows created using Galaxy can be saved and are reusable, so may be distributed within and between research groups, facilitating the construction of a set of standardised, reusable bioinformatic protocols.

Public health microbiology is currently being transformed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which opens the door to serotype determination using WGS data. SeqSero (www.denglab.info/SeqSero) is a novel Web-based tool for determining Salmonella serotypes using high-throughput genome sequencing data. SeqSero is based on curated databases of Salmonella serotype determinants (rfb gene cluster, fliC and fljB alleles) and is predicted to determine serotype rapidly and accurately for nearly the full spectrum of Salmonella serotypes (more than 2,300 serotypes), from both raw sequencing reads and genome assemblies. The performance of SeqSero was evaluated by testing (i) raw reads from genomes of 308 Salmonella isolates of known serotype; (ii) raw reads from genomes of 3,306 Salmonella isolates sequenced and made publicly available by GenomeTrakr, a U.S. national monitoring network operated by the Food and Drug Administration; and (iii) 354 other publicly available draft or complete Salmonella genomes. We also demonstrated Salmonella serotype determination from raw sequencing reads of fecal metagenomes from mice orally infected with this pathogen. SeqSero can help to maintain the well-established utility of Salmonella serotyping when integrated into a platform of WGS-based pathogen subtyping and characterization.},

abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis is a porcine adapted serovar which may cause serious outbreaks in pigs. Here we describe outbreaks of salmonellosis due to S. Choleraesuis in four Danish pig farms in 2012-2013 by clinic, serology, and microbiology and compare the isolates to those of a previous outbreak in 1999-2000. The infection was in some herds associated with high mortality and a moderate to high sero-prevalence was found. In 2012-2013 the disease contributed to increased mortality but occurred concomitant with other disease problems in the herds, which likely delayed the diagnosis by up to several months. Nine isolates from the four farms in 2012-2013 and 14 isolates obtained from the outbreak in Denmark in 1999-2000 were subjected to typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Seven isolates were selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS). The PFGE results of 23 isolates displayed five different profiles. The isolates from 2012 to 2013 revealed two distinct profiles, both different from the isolates recovered in 1999-2000. Two of the 2012-2013 farms shared PFGE profiles and had also transported pigs between them. The profile found in the two other 2012-2013 farms was indistinguishable but no epidemiological connection between these farms was found. Analysis of the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the WGS data indicated that the isolates from the farms in 2012-2013 were more closely related to each other than to isolates from the outbreak in 1999. It was therefore concluded that the infection was a new introduction and not a persistent infection since the outbreak in 1999. It may further be suggested that there were two or three independent rather than a single introduction. The re-introduction of S. Choleraesuis in Denmark emphasizes the importance of strict hygiene measures in the herds. Further investigations using WGS are now in progress on a larger collection of isolates to study clonality at European level and trace the origin of the infections.},

A total of 39 isolates were analyzed from patients (n=15) and food, feed, animal, and environmental sources (n=24), resulting in five different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. Isolates epidemiologically related to the outbreak clustered within the same pulsotype, SXB{\_}BS.0003, without any further differentiation. Thirty-three isolates were considered for genomic analysis based on different sets of SNPs, core, synonymous, nonsynonymous, as well as SNPs in different codon positions, by Bayesian and maximum likelihood algorithms. Trees generated from core and nonsynonymous SNPs, as well as SNPs at the second and first plus second codon positions detailed four distinct groups of isolates within the outbreak pulsotype, discriminating outbreak-related isolates of human and food origins. Conversely, the trees derived from synonymous and third-codon-position SNPs clustered food and human isolates together, indicating that all outbreak-related isolates constituted a single clone, which was in line with the epidemiological evidence. Further experiments are in place to extend this approach within our regional enteropathogen surveillance system.},

abstract = {Bacterial whole genome sequence (WGS) methods are rapidly overtaking classical sequence analysis. Many bacterial sequencing projects focus on mobilome changes, since macroevolutionary events, such as the acquisition or loss of mobile genetic elements, mainly plasmids, play essential roles in adaptive evolution. Existing WGS analysis protocols do not assort contigs between plasmids and the main chromosome, thus hampering full analysis of plasmid sequences. We developed a method (called plasmid constellation networks or PLACNET) that identifies, visualizes and analyzes plasmids in WGS projects by creating a network of contig interactions, thus allowing comprehensive plasmid analysis within WGS datasets. The workflow of the method is based on three types of data: assembly information (including scaffold links and coverage), comparison to reference sequences and plasmid-diagnostic sequence features. The resulting network is pruned by expert analysis, to eliminate confounding data, and implemented in a Cytoscape-based graphic representation. To demonstrate PLACNET sensitivity and efficacy, the plasmidome of the Escherichia coli lineage ST131 was analyzed. ST131 is a globally spread clonal group of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), comprising different sublineages with ability to acquire and spread antibiotic resistance and virulence genes via plasmids. Results show that plasmids flux in the evolution of this lineage, which is wide open for plasmid exchange. MOBF12/IncF plasmids were pervasive, adding just by themselves more than 350 protein families to the ST131 pangenome. Nearly 50{\%} of the most frequent $\gamma$-proteobacterial plasmid groups were found to be present in our limited sample of ten analyzed ST131 genomes, which represent the main ST131 sublineages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whole genome sequence construction is becoming increasingly feasible because of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS), including increasing throughput and read length. By simply overlapping paired-end reads, we can obtain longer reads with higher accuracy, which can facilitate the assembly process. However, the influences of different library sizes and assembly methods on paired-end sequencing-based de novo assembly remain poorly understood.

RESULTS: We used 250 bp Illumina Miseq paired-end reads of different library sizes generated from genomic DNA from Escherichia coli DH1 and Streptococcus parasanguinis FW213 to compare the assembly results of different library sizes and assembly approaches. Our data indicate that overlapping paired-end reads can increase read accuracy but sometimes cause insertion or deletions. Regarding genome assembly, merged reads only outcompete original paired-end reads when coverage depth is low, and larger libraries tend to yield better assembly results. These results imply that distance information is the most critical factor during assembly. Our results also indicate that when depth is sufficiently high, assembly from subsets can sometimes produce better results.

CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study provides systematic evaluations of de novo assembly from paired end sequencing data. Among the assembly strategies, we find that overlapping paired-end reads is not always beneficial for bacteria genome assembly and should be avoided or used with caution especially for genomes containing high fraction of repetitive sequences. Because increasing numbers of projects aim at bacteria genome sequencing, our study provides valuable suggestions for the field of genomic sequence construction.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Here we present an extensive genomic and genetic analysis of Escherichia coli strains of serotype O78 that represent the major cause of avian colisepticemia, an invasive infection caused by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strains. It is associated with high mortality and morbidity, resulting in significant economic consequences for the poultry industry. To understand the genetic basis of the virulence of avian septicemic E. coli, we sequenced the entire genome of a clinical isolate of serotype O78-O78:H19 ST88 isolate 789 (O78-9)-and compared it with three publicly available APEC O78 sequences and one complete genome of APEC serotype O1 strain. Although there was a large variability in genome content between the APEC strains, several genes were conserved, which are potentially critical for colisepticemia. Some of these genes are present in multiple copies per genome or code for gene products with overlapping function, signifying their importance. A systematic deletion of each of these virulence-related genes identified three systems that are conserved in all septicemic strains examined and are critical for serum survival, a prerequisite for septicemia. These are the plasmid-encoded protein, the defective ETT2 (E. coli type 3 secretion system 2) type 3 secretion system ETT2sepsis, and iron uptake systems. Strain O78-9 is the only APEC O78 strain that also carried the regulon coding for yersiniabactin, the iron binding system of the Yersinia high-pathogenicity island. Interestingly, this system is the only one that cannot be complemented by other iron uptake systems under iron limitation and in serum. IMPORTANCE: Avian colisepticemia is a severe systemic disease of birds causing high morbidity and mortality and resulting in severe economic losses. The bacteria associated with avian colisepticemia are highly antibiotic resistant, making antibiotic treatment ineffective, and there is no effective vaccine due to the multitude of serotypes involved. To understand the disease and work out strategies to combat it, we performed an extensive genomic and genetic analysis of Escherichia coli strains of serotype O78, the major cause of the disease. We identified several potential virulence factors, conserved in all the colisepticemic strains examined, and determined their contribution to growth in serum, an absolute requirement for septicemia. These findings raise the possibility that specific vaccines or drugs can be developed against these critical virulence factors to help combat this economically important disease.},

Prevalence of Campylobacter in food animals can exceed 80{\%} thus challenging processors to employ post-harvest pathogen reduction strategies. Reduction of pathogens before arrival to the abattoir is also of interest because the implementation of pre-harvest interventions may compliment existing post-harvest control techniques to further diminish possible retail sources of infection.

These isolates represented 20 isolates collected from human sources during the period of the outbreak and 27 control isolates collected from human, food, animal, and environmental sources before the outbreak. Based on 253 high-confidence SNPs, we were able to reconstruct a tip-dated molecular clock phylogeny of the isolates and to assign four human isolates to the actual outbreak. We developed an SNP typing assay to rapidly discriminate between outbreak-related cases and non-outbreak-related cases and tested this assay on an extended panel of 112 isolates. These results suggest that only a very small percentage of the human isolates with the outbreak PFGE pattern and obtained during the outbreak period could be attributed to the actual pepper-related outbreak (20{\%}), while the majority (80{\%}) of the putative cases represented background cases. This study demonstrates that next-generation-based SNP typing provides the resolution and accuracy needed for outbreak investigations of food-borne pathogens that cannot be distinguished by currently used subtyping methods.},

abstract = {Since the read lengths of high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are short, de novo assembly which plays significant roles in many applications remains a great challenge. Most of the state-of-the-art approaches base on de Bruijn graph strategy and overlap-layout strategy. However, these approaches which depend on k-mers or read overlaps do not fully utilize information of paired-end and single-end reads when resolving branches. Since they treat all single-end reads with overlapped length larger than a fix threshold equally, they fail to use the more confident long overlapped reads for assembling and mix up with the relative short overlapped reads. Moreover, these approaches have not been special designed for handling tandem repeats (repeats occur adjacently in the genome) and they usually break down the contigs near the tandem repeats. We present PERGA (Paired-End Reads Guided Assembler), a novel sequence-reads-guided de novo assembly approach, which adopts greedy-like prediction strategy for assembling reads to contigs and scaffolds using paired-end reads and different read overlap size ranging from Omax to Omin to resolve the gaps and branches. By constructing a decision model using machine learning approach based on branch features, PERGA can determine the correct extension in 99.7{\%} of cases. When the correct extension cannot be determined, PERGA will try to extend the contig by all feasible extensions and determine the correct extension by using look-ahead approach. Many difficult-resolved branches are due to tandem repeats which are close in the genome. PERGA detects such different copies of the repeats to resolve the branches to make the extension much longer and more accurate. We evaluated PERGA on both Illumina real and simulated datasets ranging from small bacterial genomes to large human chromosome, and it constructed longer and more accurate contigs and scaffolds than other state-of-the-art assemblers. PERGA can be freely downloaded at https://github.com/hitbio/PERGA.},

abstract = {The enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica is one of the leading causes of foodborne illness in the world. The species is extremely diverse, containing more than 2,500 named serovars that are designated for their unique antigen characters and pathogenicity profiles-some are known to be virulent pathogens, while others are not. Questions regarding the evolution of pathogenicity, significance of antigen characters, diversity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci, among others, will remain elusive until a strong evolutionary framework is established. We present the first large-scale S. enterica subsp. enterica phylogeny inferred from a new reference-free k-mer approach of gathering single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole genomes. The phylogeny of 156 isolates representing 78 serovars (102 were newly sequenced) reveals two major lineages, each with many strongly supported sublineages. One of these lineages is the S. Typhi group; well nested within the phylogeny. Lineage-through-time analyses suggest there have been two instances of accelerated rates of diversification within the subspecies. We also found that antigen characters and CRISPR loci reveal different evolutionary patterns than that of the phylogeny, suggesting that a horizontal gene transfer or possibly a shared environmental acquisition might have influenced the present character distribution. Our study also shows the ability to extract reference-free SNPs from a large set of genomes and then to use these SNPs for phylogenetic reconstruction. This automated, annotation-free approach is an important step forward for bacterial disease tracking and in efficiently elucidating the evolutionary history of highly clonal organisms.},

A total of 52 S. enterica serotype Enteritidis isolates representing 16 major outbreaks and three sporadic cases collected between 2001 and 2012 were sequenced and subjected to subtyping by four different methods: (i) whole-genome single-nucleotide-polymorphism typing (WGST), (ii) multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA), (iii) clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats combined with multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (CRISPR-MVLST), and (iv) pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). WGST resolved all outbreak clusters and provided useful robust phylogenetic inference results with high epidemiological correlation. While both MLVA and CRISPR-MVLST yielded higher discriminatory power than PFGE, MLVA outperformed the other methods in delineating outbreak clusters whereas CRISPR-MVLST showed the potential to trace major lineages and ecological origins of S. enterica serotype Enteritidis.

abstract = {The wide availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and an abundance of open-source software have made detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in bacterial genomes an increasingly accessible and effective tool for comparative analyses. Thus, ensuring that real nucleotide differences between genomes (i.e., true SNPs) are detected at high rates and that the influences of errors (such as false positive SNPs, ambiguously called sites, and gaps) are mitigated is of utmost importance. The choices researchers make regarding the generation and analysis of WGS data can greatly influence the accuracy of short-read sequence alignments and, therefore, the efficacy of such experiments. We studied the effects of some of these choices, including: i) depth of sequencing coverage, ii) choice of reference-guided short-read sequence assembler, iii) choice of reference genome, and iv) whether to perform read-quality filtering and trimming, on our ability to detect true SNPs and on the frequencies of errors. We performed benchmarking experiments, during which we assembled simulated and real Listeria monocytogenes strain 08-5578 short-read sequence datasets of varying quality with four commonly used assemblers (BWA, MOSAIK, Novoalign, and SMALT), using reference genomes of varying genetic distances, and with or without read pre-processing (i.e., quality filtering and trimming). We found that assemblies of at least 50-fold coverage provided the most accurate results. In addition, MOSAIK yielded the fewest errors when reads were aligned to a nearly identical reference genome, while using SMALT to align reads against a reference sequence that is ∼0.82{\%} distant from 08-5578 at the nucleotide level resulted in the detection of the greatest numbers of true SNPs and the fewest errors. Finally, we show that whether read pre-processing improves SNP detection depends upon the choice of reference sequence and assembler. In total, this study demonstrates that researchers should test a variety of conditions to achieve optimal results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The opportunities for bacterial population genomics that are being realised by the application of parallel nucleotide sequencing require novel bioinformatics platforms. These must be capable of the storage, retrieval, and analysis of linked phenotypic and genotypic information in an accessible, scalable and computationally efficient manner.

RESULTS: The Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSDB) is a scalable, open source, web-accessible database system that meets these needs, enabling phenotype and sequence data, which can range from a single sequence read to whole genome data, to be efficiently linked for a limitless number of bacterial specimens. The system builds on the widely used mlstdbNet software, developed for the storage and distribution of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data, and incorporates the capacity to define and identify any number of loci and genetic variants at those loci within the stored nucleotide sequences. These loci can be further organised into 'schemes' for isolate characterisation or for evolutionary or functional analyses. Isolates and loci can be indexed by multiple names and any number of alternative schemes can be accommodated, enabling cross-referencing of different studies and approaches. LIMS functionality of the software enables linkage to and organisation of laboratory samples. The data are easily linked to external databases and fine-grained authentication of access permits multiple users to participate in community annotation by setting up or contributing to different schemes within the database. Some of the applications of BIGSDB are illustrated with the genera Neisseria and Streptococcus.The BIGSDB source code and documentation are available at http://pubmlst.org/software/database/bigsdb/.

CONCLUSIONS: Genomic data can be used to characterise bacterial isolates in many different ways but it can also be efficiently exploited for evolutionary or functional studies. BIGSDB represents a freely available resource that will assist the broader community in the elucidation of the structure and function of bacteria by means of a population genomics approach.},

abstract = {Minimum spanning trees (MSTs) are frequently used in molecular epidemiology research to estimate relationships among individual strains or isolates. Nevertheless, there are significant caveats to MST algorithms that have been largely ignored in molecular epidemiology studies and that have the potential to confound or alter the interpretation of the results of those analyses. Specifically, (i) presenting a single, arbitrarily selected MST illustrates only one of potentially many equally optimal solutions, and (ii) statistical metrics are not used to assess the credibility of MST estimations. Here, we survey published MSTs previously used to infer microbial population structure in order to determine the effect of these factors. We propose a technique to estimate the number of alternative MSTs for a data set and find that multiple MSTs exist for each case in our survey. By implementing a bootstrapping metric to evaluate the reliability of alternative MST solutions, we discover that they encompass a wide range of credibility values. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that current approaches to studying population structure using MSTs are inadequate. We instead propose a systematic approach to MST estimation that bases analyses on the optimal computation of an input distance matrix, provides information about the number and configurations of alternative MSTs, and allows identification of the most credible MST or MSTs by using a bootstrapping metric. It is our hope this algorithm will become the new "gold standard" approach for analyzing MSTs for molecular epidemiology so that this generally useful computational approach can be used informatively and to its full potential.},

RESULTS: I present some of the most notable new features and extensions of RAxML, such as a substantial extension of substitution models and supported data types, the introduction of SSE3, AVX and AVX2 vector intrinsics, techniques for reducing the memory requirements of the code and a plethora of operations for conducting post-analyses on sets of trees. In addition, an up-to-date 50-page user manual covering all new RAxML options is available.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Technological advances in high throughput genome sequencing are making whole genome sequencing (WGS) available as a routine tool for bacterial typing. Standardized procedures for identification of relevant genes and of variation are needed to enable comparison between studies and over time. The core genes--the genes that are conserved in all (or most) members of a genus or species--are potentially good candidates for investigating genomic variation in phylogeny and epidemiology.

RESULTS: We identify a set of 2,882 core genes clusters based on 73 publicly available Salmonella enterica genomes and evaluate their value as typing targets, comparing whole genome typing and traditional methods such as 16S and MLST. A consensus tree based on variation of core genes gives much better resolution than 16S and MLST; the pan-genome family tree is similar to the consensus tree, but with higher confidence. The core genes can be divided into two categories: a few highly variable genes and a larger set of conserved core genes, with low variance. For the most variable core genes, the variance in amino acid sequences is higher than for the corresponding nucleotide sequences, suggesting that there is a positive selection towards mutations leading to amino acid changes.

CONCLUSIONS: Genomic variation within the core genome is useful for investigating molecular evolution and providing candidate genes for bacterial genome typing. Identification of genes with different degrees of variation is important especially in trend analysis.},

abstract = {Experimental and epidemiological evidence has indicated the respiratory route to be a potential portal of entry for salmonellas in poultry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the infectivity of Salmonella enterica serovar Senftenberg following oral gavage, intratracheal or intravenous challenge in chickens. Seven-day-old chicks were challenged with either 10(4) or 10(6) colony-forming units of S. Senftenberg per chick by oral gavage, intratracheal or intravenous challenge, respectively, in two independent trials. Chickens were humanely killed 24 h post challenge and S. Senftenberg was cultured and enumerated from caecal contents, caecal tissue-caecal tonsils and liver and spleen. In both trials, intratracheal delivery of S. Senftenberg was the only route that allowed colonization of the caeca of chickens when compared with oral gavage or intravenous challenge in a dose response fashion (P {\textless} 0.05). Liver and spleen samples yielded no S. Seftenberg after the lower dose challenge by the oral or intratracheal route and only low levels following the high-dose administration by these routes, whereas intravenous challenge resulted in recovery of the organisms after both doses. The results of the present study suggest that S. Senftenberg entering the blood is likely to be cleared and will not be able to colonize caeca to the same extent as compared with intratracheal challenge. Clarification of the potential importance of the respiratory tract for transmission of salmonellas under field conditions may be of critical importance to develop intervention strategies to reduce the transmission in poultry.},

abstract = {High-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) is of increasing importance in the life sciences. One of its most prominent applications is the sequencing of whole genomes or targeted regions of the genome such as all exonic regions (i.e., the exome). Here, the objective is the identification of genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The extraction of SNPs from the raw genetic sequences involves many processing steps and the application of a diverse set of tools. We review the essential building blocks for a pipeline that calls SNPs from raw HTS data. The pipeline includes quality control, mapping of short reads to the reference genome, visualization and post-processing of the alignment including base quality recalibration. The final steps of the pipeline include the SNP calling procedure along with filtering of SNP candidates. The steps of this pipeline are accompanied by an analysis of a publicly available whole-exome sequencing dataset. To this end, we employ several alignment programs and SNP calling routines for highlighting the fact that the choice of the tools significantly affects the final results.},

We generated whole-genome sequences for 19 Typhi isolates using 454 (Roche) and Solexa (Illumina) technologies. Isolates, including the previously sequenced CT18 and Ty2 isolates, were selected to represent major nodes in the phylogenetic tree. Comparative analysis showed little evidence of purifying selection, antigenic variation or recombination between isolates. Rather, evolution in the Typhi population seems to be characterized by ongoing loss of gene function, consistent with a small effective population size. The lack of evidence for antigenic variation driven by immune selection is in contrast to strong adaptive selection for mutations conferring antibiotic resistance in Typhi. The observed patterns of genetic isolation and drift are consistent with the proposed key role of asymptomatic carriers of Typhi as the main reservoir of this pathogen, highlighting the need for identification and treatment of carriers.},

When integrated into existing web services GenomeD3Plot allows researchers to interact with data, dynamically alter the view, or even resize or reposition the visualization in their browser window. In addition GenomeD3Plot has built in functionality to export any resulting genome visualization in PNG or SVG format for easy inclusion in manuscripts or presentations. RESULTS: GenomeD3Plot is being utilized in the recently released Islandviewer 3 (www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/) to visualize predicted genomic islands with other genome annotation data.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies produce large volumes of fragmented genome reads, which require large amounts of memory to assemble the complete genome efficiently. With recent improvements in DNA sequencing technologies, it is expected that the memory footprint required for the assembly process will increase dramatically and will emerge as a limiting factor in processing widely available NGS-generated reads. In this report, we compare current memory-efficient techniques for genome assembly with respect to quality, memory consumption and execution time. Our experiments prove that it is possible to generate draft assemblies of reasonable quality on conventional multi-purpose computers with very limited available memory by choosing suitable assembly methods. Our study reveals the minimum memory requirements for different assembly programs even when data volume exceeds memory capacity by orders of magnitude. By combining existing methodologies, we propose two general assembly strategies that can improve short-read assembly approaches and result in reduction of the memory footprint. Finally, we discuss the possibility of utilizing cloud infrastructures for genome assembly and we comment on some findings regarding suitable computational resources for assembly.},

abstract = {Whole-genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to retrospectively examine 57 isolates from five epidemiologically confirmed community outbreaks (numbered 1 to 5) caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium phage type DT170. Most of the human and environmental isolates confirmed epidemiologically to be involved in the outbreaks were either genomically identical or differed by one or two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with the exception of those in outbreak 1. The isolates from outbreak 1 differed by up to 12 SNPs, which suggests that the food source of the outbreak was contaminated with more than one strain while each of the other four outbreaks was caused by a single strain. In addition, NGS analysis ruled in isolates that were initially not considered to be linked with the outbreak, which increased the total outbreak size by 107{\%}. The mutation process was modeled by using known mutation rates to derive a cutoff value for the number of SNP difference to determine whether or not a case was part of an outbreak. For an outbreak with less than 1 month of ex vivo/in vivo evolution time, the maximum number of SNP differences between isolates is two or four using the lowest or highest mutation rate, respectively. NGS of S. Typhimurium significantly increases the resolution of investigations of community outbreaks. It can also inform a more targeted public health response by providing important supplementary evidence that cases of disease are or are not associated with food-borne outbreaks of S. Typhimurium.},

abstract = {The Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis, Dublin, and Gallinarum are closely related but differ in virulence and host range. To identify the genetic elements responsible for these differences and to better understand how these serovars are evolving, we sequenced the genomes of Enteritidis strain LK5 and Dublin strain SARB12 and compared these genomes to the publicly available Enteritidis P125109, Dublin CT 02021853 and Dublin SD3246 genome sequences. We also compared the publicly available Gallinarum genome sequences from biotype Gallinarum 287/91 and Pullorum RKS5078. Using bioinformatic approaches, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, deletions, and differences in prophage and pseudogene content between strains belonging to the same serovar. Through our analysis we also identified several prophage cargo genes and pseudogenes that affect virulence and may contribute to a host-specific, systemic lifestyle. These results strongly argue that the Enteritidis, Dublin and Gallinarum serovars of Salmonella enterica evolve by acquiring new genes through horizontal gene transfer, followed by the formation of pseudogenes. The loss of genes necessary for a gastrointestinal lifestyle ultimately leads to a systemic lifestyle and niche exclusion in the host-specific serovars.},

abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is a significant cause of gastrointestinal illness in the United States; however, current molecular subtyping methods lack resolution for this highly clonal serovar. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have made it possible to examine whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as a potential molecular subtyping tool for outbreak detection and source trace back. Here, we conducted a retrospective analysis of S. Enteritidis isolates from seven epidemiologically confirmed foodborne outbreaks and sporadic isolates (not epidemiologically linked) to determine the utility of WGS to identify outbreaks. A collection of 55 epidemiologically characterized clinical and environmental S. Enteritidis isolates were sequenced. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based cluster analysis of the S.

Sporadic isolates were an average of 42.5 SNPs distant from the outbreak clusters. Isolates collected from the same patient over several weeks differed by only two SNPs. Our findings show that WGS provided greater resolution between outbreak, sporadic, and suspect isolates than the current gold standard subtyping method, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

abstract = {Infections with non-typhoidal Salmonella strains are constant and are a non-negligible threat to the human population. In the last two decades, salmonellosis outbreaks have increasingly been associated with infected fruits and vegetables. For a long time, Salmonellae were assumed to survive on plants after a more or less accidental infection. However, this notion has recently been challenged. Studies on the infection mechanism in vegetal hosts, as well as on plant immune systems, revealed an active infection process resembling in certain features the infection in animals. On one hand, Salmonella requires the type III secretion systems to effectively infect plants and to suppress their resistance mechanisms. On the other hand, plants recognize these bacteria and react to the infection with an induced defense mechanism similar to the reaction to other plant pathogens. In this review, we present the newest reports on the interaction between Salmonellae and plants. We discuss the possible ways used by these bacteria to infect plants as well as the plant responses to the infection. The recent findings indicate that plants play a central role in the dissemination of Salmonella within the ecosystem.},

abstract = {The 'natural refuge strategy" for delaying insect resistance to transgenic cotton that produces insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) relies on refuges of host plants other than cotton that do not make Bt toxins. We tested this widely adopted strategy by comparing predictions from modeling with data from a four-year field study of cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) resistance to transgenic cotton producing Bt toxin Cry1Ac in six provinces of northern China. Bioassay data revealed that the percentage of resistant insects increased from 0.93{\%} in 2010 to 5.5{\%} in 2013. Modeling predicted that the percentage of resistant insects would exceed 98{\%} in 2013 without natural refuges, but would increase to only 1.1{\%} if natural refuges were as effective as non-Bt cotton refuges. Therefore, the results imply that natural refuges delayed resistance, but were not as effective as an equivalent area of non-Bt cotton refuges. The percentage of resistant insects with nonrecessive inheritance of resistance increased from 37{\%} in 2010 to 84{\%} in 2013. Switching to Bt cotton producing two or more toxins and integrating other control tactics could slow further increases in resistance.},

@article{Lassalle2015,
abstract = {The characterization of functional elements in genomes relies on the identification of the footprints of natural selection. In this quest, taking into account neutral evolutionary processes such as mutation and genetic drift is crucial because these forces can generate patterns that may obscure or mimic signatures of selection. In mammals, and probably in many eukaryotes, another such confounding factor called GC-Biased Gene Conversion (gBGC) has been documented. This mechanism generates patterns identical to what is expected under selection for higher GC-content, specifically in highly recombining genomic regions. Recent results have suggested that a mysterious selective force favouring higher GC-content exists in Bacteria but the possibility that it could be gBGC has been excluded. Here, we show that gBGC is probably at work in most if not all bacterial species. First we find a consistent positive relationship between the GC-content of a gene and evidence of intra-genic recombination throughout a broad spectrum of bacterial clades. Second, we show that the evolutionary force responsible for this pattern is acting independently from selection on codon usage, and could potentially interfere with selection in favor of optimal AU-ending codons. A comparison with data from human populations shows that the intensity of gBGC in Bacteria is comparable to what has been reported in mammals. We propose that gBGC is not restricted to sexual Eukaryotes but also widespread among Bacteria and could therefore be an ancestral feature of cellular organisms. We argue that if gBGC occurs in bacteria, it can account for previously unexplained observations, such as the apparent non-equilibrium of base substitution patterns and the heterogeneity of gene composition within bacterial genomes. Because gBGC produces patterns similar to positive selection, it is essential to take this process into account when studying the evolutionary forces at work in bacterial genomes.},

@article{McWhorter2015,
abstract = {There are over 2500 Salmonella enterica serovars that circulate globally. Of these, serovars those classified into subspecies I are the most common cause of human salmonellosis. Many subspecies I Salmonella serovars are routinely isolated from egg farm environments but are not frequently associated with causing disease in humans. In this study, virulence profiles were generated for 10 strains of Salmonella enterica isolated directly from egg farm environments to investigate their potential public health risk. Three virulence parameters were assessed including in vitro invasion, in vivo pathogenicity and characterization of genomic variation within five specific pathogenicity islands. These 10 Salmonella strains exhibited significant differences in invasion into the human intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco2. Low, moderate, and high invasion patterns were observed and the degree of invasion was dependent on bacterial growth in a nutritive environment. Interestingly, two Salmonella strains, S. Adelaide and S. Bredeney had consistently low invasion. The S. Typhimurium definitive types and S. Virchow exhibited the greatest cell invasion following growth in Luria Bertani broth. Only the S. Typhimurium strains caused disease in BALB/c mice, yet the majority of serovars were consistently detected in feces over the 21 day experiment. Genomic comparison of the five specific pathogenicity islands has shown that variation in virulence is likely multifactorial. Sequence variability was observed primarily in strains with low virulence. In particular, genes involved in forming the structures of the SPI-1 and SPI-2 type 3 secretion systems as well as multiple effector proteins were among the most variable. This variability suggest that serovars with low virulence are likely to have both invasion and within host replication defects that ultimately limit their pathogenicity.},

abstract = {Salmonella enterica is divided into four subspecies containing a large number of different serovars, several of which are important zoonotic pathogens and some show a high degree of host specificity or host preference. We compare 45 sequenced S. enterica genomes that are publicly available (22 complete and 23 draft genome sequences). Of these, 35 were found to be of sufficiently good quality to allow a detailed analysis, along with two Escherichia coli strains (K-12 substr. DH10B and the avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC O1) strain). All genomes were subjected to standardized gene finding, and the core and pan-genome of Salmonella were estimated to be around 2,800 and 10,000 gene families, respectively. The constructed pan-genomic dendrograms suggest that gene content is often, but not uniformly correlated to serotype. Any given Salmonella strain has a large stable core, whilst there is an abundance of accessory genes, including the Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs), transposable elements, phages, and plasmid DNA. We visualize conservation in the genomes in relation to chromosomal location and DNA structural features and find that variation in gene content is localized in a selection of variable genomic regions or islands. These include the SPIs but also encompass phage insertion sites and transposable elements. The islands were typically well conserved in several, but not all, isolates--a difference which may have implications in, e.g., host specificity.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

More than 90{\%} of LD cases are caused by Legionella pneumophila, and studies on the origin and transmission routes of this pathogen rely on adequate molecular characterization of isolates. Current typing of L. pneumophila mainly depends on sequence-based typing (SBT). However, studies have shown that in some outbreak situations, SBT does not have sufficient discriminatory power to distinguish between related and nonrelated L. pneumophila isolates. In this study, we used a novel high-resolution typing technique, called whole-genome mapping (WGM), to differentiate between epidemiologically related and nonrelated L. pneumophila isolates. Assessment of the method by various validation experiments showed highly reproducible results, and WGM was able to confirm two well-documented Dutch L. pneumophila outbreaks. Comparison of whole-genome maps of the two outbreaks together with WGMs of epidemiologically nonrelated L. pneumophila isolates showed major differences between the maps, and WGM yielded a higher discriminatory power than SBT. In conclusion, WGM can be a valuable alternative to perform outbreak investigations of L. pneumophila in real time since the turnaround time from culture to comparison of the L. pneumophila maps is less than 24 h.},

abstract = {Salmonella-infected poultry products are a major source of human Salmonella infection. The prophylactic use of antimicrobials in poultry production was recently banned in the EU, increasing the need for alternative methods to control Salmonella infections in poultry flocks. Genetic selection of chickens more resistant to Salmonella colonization provides an attractive means of sustainably controlling the pathogen in commercial poultry flocks and its subsequent entry into the food chain. Analysis of different inbred chickens has shown that individual lines are consistently either susceptible or resistant to the many serovars of Salmonella that have been tested. In this study, two inbred chicken lines with differential susceptibility to Salmonella colonization (61 ((R)) and N((S)) ) were used in a backcross experimental design. Unlike previous studies that used a candidate gene approach or low-density genome-wide screens, we have exploited a high-density marker set of 1255 SNPs covering the whole genome to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL). Analysis of log-transformed caecal bacterial levels between the parental lines revealed a significant difference at 1, 2, 3 and 4 days post-infection (P {\textless} 0.05). Analysis of the genotypes of the backcross (F1 × N) population (n = 288) revealed four QTL on chromosomes 2, 3, 12 and 25 for the two traits examined in this study: log-transformed bacterial counts in the caeca and presence of a hardened caseous caecal core. These included one genome-wide significant QTL on chromosome 2 at 20 Mb and three additional QTL, on chromosomes 3, 12 and 25 at 96, 15 and 1 Mb, respectively, which were significant at the chromosome-wide level (P {\textless} 0.05). The results generated in this study will inform future breeding strategies to control these pathogens in commercial poultry flocks.},

@article{Tritt2012,
abstract = {Remarkable advances in DNA sequencing technology have created a need for de novo genome assembly methods tailored to work with the new sequencing data types. Many such methods have been published in recent years, but assembling raw sequence data to obtain a draft genome has remained a complex, multi-step process, involving several stages of sequence data cleaning, error correction, assembly, and quality control. Successful application of these steps usually requires intimate knowledge of a diverse set of algorithms and software. We present an assembly pipeline called A5 (Andrew And Aaron's Awesome Assembly pipeline) that simplifies the entire genome assembly process by automating these stages, by integrating several previously published algorithms with new algorithms for quality control and automated assembly parameter selection. We demonstrate that A5 can produce assemblies of quality comparable to a leading assembly algorithm, SOAPdenovo, without any prior knowledge of the particular genome being assembled and without the extensive parameter tuning required by the other assembly algorithm. In particular, the assemblies produced by A5 exhibit 50{\%} or more reduction in broken protein coding sequences relative to SOAPdenovo assemblies. The A5 pipeline can also assemble Illumina sequence data from libraries constructed by the Nextera (transposon-catalyzed) protocol, which have markedly different characteristics to mechanically sheared libraries. Finally, A5 has modest compute requirements, and can assemble a typical bacterial genome on current desktop or laptop computer hardware in under two hours, depending on depth of coverage.},
