    \begin{itemize}
      \item Infection with \heidelberg is one of the leading causes of Salmonellosis in North America.
      \item \Mdr \heidelberg isolates were identified in poultry meat imported from South America into the Netherlands.
      \item Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate this potential public health risk.
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \headerbox{Materials and Methods}{name=MM,below=introduction} {
    \padd
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A retrospective study was performed to investigate the diversity of isolates from Brazil (n=114) and Argentina (n=2) isolated between 2010 and 2014.
      \item Isolates were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500. As controls, two independent poultry batches were sampled and sequenced five times, and a single isolate was sequenced twice.
      \item Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility (Sensititre) and the presence of resistance genes (PCR).
      \item Publicly available Illumina reads from three separate outbreaks (n=5 per outbreak) in \fcite{Canada}{1} were included in the analysis, as were isolates from \fcite{Thailand}{2} (n=2) and \fcite{Colombia}{3} (n=2).
      \item Quality control was performed with FastQC and Trimmomatic. \!Reads were mapped against \heidelberg \reference using BWA.
      \item Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) with a read depth $\geq\!\!\!5$ were called based on the GATK~best practices. 
      \item Concatenated SNPs were analysed with RAxML, and bootstrap support was calculated (cut-off $\geq\!80$).
      \item Multilocus Sequence Types (MLST) were determined from the WGS data using the \textit{Salmonella enterica} scheme from pubmlst.org
    \end{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
          \item Isolates from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Thailand, and three separate Canadian outbreaks were all classified into separate clusters, see \textbf{Figure 1}.
          \item The control isolate that was sequenced twice clustered as expected, as did the majority of the batch control isolates.
          \item A single isolate from the batch control did not cluster, most likely because the batch contained meat from multiple sources.
          \item All isolates were characterised as Multilocus Sequence Type 15, except for one isolate which had a single SNP in the \textit{thrA-12} allele.

      \columnbreak

      \item \textbf{Table 1} shows the different antimicrobial resistance profiles (EUCAST cut-off values).

      \item While MLST assigned the same Sequence Type to each isolate, the SNP analysis can reliably differentiate isolates from different outbreaks and countries.
      \item The closely related isolates from Brazil show high diversity with few sub-clusters, which suggests that our study only captured a small subset of the existing diversity in Brazil.
      %\item This suggests a diverse, endemic population of \heidelberg that infects poultry meat from Brazil.
      \item The high diversity of \heidelberg isolates suggests the presence of an endemic, \mdr population in the poultry chain in Brazil.
