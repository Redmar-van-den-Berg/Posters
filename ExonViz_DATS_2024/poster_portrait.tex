    % \noindent The tool can be accessed through \mbox{\url{https://exonviz.rnatherapy.nl}}
    % and can also be installed as a command line tool for advanced features.

      \item Set the exon and variant colors, and the variant shape (\option{pin} or \option{bar})

    \padd
    \noindent
    \exonviz draws transcripts from any species, and includes features
    like exon frames, coding region and variants. All feature sizes and variant
    positions are biologically accurate, according to the specified transcript.
    The user can specify custom transcripts and variants via a simple Excel
    file, as described in the extensive online documentation.
    ExonViz is written in Python, and uses the Mutalyzer$^2$ API to fetch
    transcript annotations. The web interface is written in Flask.
    \newline
    \newline
    \noindent
    Figures generated with \exonviz can be freely used in publications and
    presentations.
